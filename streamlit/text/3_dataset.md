### Our World in Data (OWID)
- OWID provides access to a variety of global collated data
- Rather than make things easy, I settled on data regarding CO2 and Energy
- My intention was to use the CO2 data and enrich it with the Energy data to provide an analysis of the relationship between energy consumption/generation and CO2 emissions
