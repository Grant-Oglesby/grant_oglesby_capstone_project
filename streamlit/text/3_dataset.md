### Our World in Data (OWID)
- The dataset I identified was from Our World in Data (OWID)
- OWID provides access to a variety of global collated data
- Rather than make things easy for myself, I settled on two data sets regarding CO2 and Energy, with over 70k records between them
- My intention was to use the CO2 data and enrich it with the Energy data to provide an analysis of the relationship between energy consumption/generation and CO2 emissions
- With so much attention on the climate crisis, I felt it was important to focus on these two critical areas and I was expecting to find correlations between population size, gdp amount, and varying levels of energy consumption and CO2 emissions
