### Extract
- The data was held in CSV files and were easily retrieved via a GET request
- I may have had my download speed throttled after I kept making requests to the source as part of my pipeline testing
- The datasets were stored in a local folder 'data/raw', loaded into pandas DataFrames for processing and saved to 'data/extract'
- The last part was so I wouldn't have GitHub mad at me again for all the GET requests
